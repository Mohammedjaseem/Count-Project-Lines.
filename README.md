# Count-Project-Lines.
To get the total number of lines in your Python project, you can use a Python script to traverse all the files in your project and count the lines


      import os

      def count_lines(file_path):
          with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
              return sum(1 for _ in file)

      def count_lines_in_directory(directory):
          total_lines = 0
          for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
              for file in files:
                  if file.endswith('.py'):  # Consider only Python files
                      file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                      total_lines += count_lines(file_path)
          return total_lines
      
      project_directory = '/path/to/your/project'
      total_lines = count_lines_in_directory(project_directory)
      print(f"Total number of lines in the project: {total_lines}")
      

In this script, the count_lines() function takes a file path and returns the number of lines in that file. The count_lines_in_directory() function traverses through the given directory and counts the lines in all the Python files within that directory (and its subdirectories) using the count_lines() function. Finally, the total number of lines is printed.

Replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to your Python project directory, and run the script. It will calculate and display the total number of lines in your Python project.
